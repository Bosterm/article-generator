        <h2>Background Information</h2>
        <p>
          For thousands of years, the land that we know of today as the state of
          Illinois was home to many indigenous people deserving of our respect
          and acknowledgement today. The campus of the University of Illinois at
          Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in particular is the land of the Peoria,
          Kaskaskia, Piankashaw, Wea, Miami, Mascoutin, Odawa, Sauk, Mesquaki,
          Kickapoo, Potawatomi, Ojibwe, and Chickasaw Nations.<sup

          The arrival of Anglo-American settlers to Illinois in the late 18th
          and early 19th centuries brought a violent, oppressive colonialism in
          which white Americans brutally attacked and killed the idigenous
          peoples of Illinois. The survivors of this violent ethnic cleansing
          were forcefully removed to regions outside of the state. This
          cleansing was so absolute that no Native American reservations exist
          in the state of Illinois today.<sup

        <p>
          The forced removal of indigenous peoples throughout the United States
          allowed the federal government to sell land previously home to Native
          Americans to white Americans. The federal government then set aside
          profits from these land sales to fund the establishment of
          universities. One of these institutions was UIUC, established to
          promote the “civilizing” process that would transform young Americans
          into “industrious, civilized” adults, a critical part of the
          colonialist process.
        </p>
        <p>
          About a century after UIUC was established, in 1966, tobacco heiress
          and philanthropist Doris Duke began awarding grants to universities to
          collect oral histories from Indigenous peoples throughout the United
          States. One of these grants was awarded to the anthropology department
          of UIUC. The oral history program began at UIUC the following year,
          1967, under the direction of anthropology professor Edward Bruner. In
          addition to additional anthropology professors, the program also had
          input from three historians. However, the bulk of the oral history
          collection and community engagement was undertaken by project field
          workers, who were predominantly anthropology graduate students.
        </p>
        <p>
          Possibly the greatest challenge faced by this program is the
          significant absence of any Native American reservations in Illinois, a
          long standing consequence of how the state was established. According
          to the Duke report, there were few Indigenous Americans enrolled at
          the university in the 1960s, and the project identified the Native
          American community in Chicago as the only significant Native American
          community in the state of Illinois. As a result, field workers had to
          travel to communities geographically distant from the campus in
          Champaign-Urbana. Instead of the university or the anthropology
          department developing a cooperative, reciprocal relationship with a
          smaller, local Indigenous community, it became the responsibility of
          individual field workers to build relationships with Indigenous
          communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The results of this strategy were mixed. Graduate student field
          workers received specialized instruction from anthropology faculty and
          worked under their supervision. However, geographic distance and the
          comparatively limited communication technologies of the 1960s and ‘70s
          meant that field workers had a great deal of individual responsibility
          to develop relationships with the Native American community they were
          working with. As a result, the quality and form of the oral histories
          and other collected materials varies widely, with the Duke report
          describing some projects as largely successful while stating that
          others “can only be classified as failures.” The report does not go
          into extensive detail into the nature of these failures, but it does
          note that in some cases the project withdrew financial support from
          the field worker.
        </p>
        <p>
          In most cases, field workers spent several months or even a year
          establishing relationships with the Indigenous community. Many of
          these field workers had particular anthropological interests that may
          not have prioritized the collection of archival material. By and
          large, the oral histories and other materials focus on depth and
          intimacy rather than a broad scope of information about the Indigenous
          community.
        </p>
        <p>
          As was common practice for anthropologists at the time, the field
          researchers did not obtain written consent to conduct an oral history
          with their subjects, but instead presumably obtained oral consent.
          There is little lasting record describing the nature of these
          conversations between researchers and subjects, and it may be the case
          that these conversations and agreements varied for both researchers
          and subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the program concluded in the early 1970s, the collection was
          physically housed with the anthropology department for several
          decades. In 2002, Anthropology Department Chair Brenda Farnell
          approached the University Archive about transferring ownership of the
          Doris Duke collection to the archive. After agreeing to house the
          materials, the University Archive had to decide how accessible the
          collection should be to the general public. After consulting the code
          of ethics for both the Society of American Archivists (SAA) and the
          American Anthropological Association that existed at the time,
          University Archives decided to make the materials accessible to the
          general public with some level of restriction for particular materials
          in the collection. University Archives reached out to the original
          field researchers to establish what level of access should be
          established for the materials in the Duke Collection.
        </p>
        <p>
          After hearing back from most of the field researchers, in 2003 the
          University Archives established an access policy for the materials
          with three levels of access for different parts of the collection:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Level 1 Open: 5 of the projects in which field researchers said they
            and the tribe they were working with were comfortable with the
            materials being accessible to the general public.
          </li>
          <li>
            Level 2 Restricted: 21 of the projects, where patrons could access
            the materials after completing an access request form. Patrons
            agreed to not release any sensitive or publicly identifiable (PII)
            information. This level of access was established for the large
            majority of the collection.
          </li>
          <li>
            Level 3 Confidential: Field notes from each of the projects as
            written by field workers and a research paper for one of the
            projects.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Additionally, any PII was restricted, and researchers using the
          materials were required to respect the anonymity of any individuals
          represented in the materials.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 2003, nine people have requested access to level 2 materials.
          Three to four of these were representatives of native nations. In
          addition to those representatives, some graduate students in the
          American Indian Studies program at UIUC and other historians and
          scholars have worked with the materials.

        <h2>Extent of Materials</h2>
        <p>
          The archival collection consists of 26 projects conducted by various
          field workers and the materials they collected. These materials
          include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Field notes</li>
          <li>Interview tapes</li>
          <li>Interview transcripts</li>
          <li>Photographs</li>
          <li>
            Documents, including newspaper clippings, informational pamphlets,
            official documents, and other papers related to Native American
            communities
          </li>
          <li>
            PhD dissertations and other academic papers written by the field
            workers
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The collection also includes tape recordings of Native American music.
        </p>
        <p>
          To give a sense of the nature of these projects, here are two projects
          highlighted in the Duke report as particularly successful:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Dr. Merwyn S. Garbarino, an anthropology professor at the University
            of Illinois Chicago of Native American descent, conducted research
            into Native Americans living in the greater Chicago region and
            worked for family and welfare services for Chicago Native Americans.
            Her area of interest was Native Americans and the urban experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            Norma Linton, an anthropology graduate student who lived with the
            Crow people in their Montana reservation for nearly a year and
            became deeply embedded into the community. She was adopted into the
            Crow tribe and participated in their Sun Dance.
          </li>

        <h2>Recent Developments</h2>
        <p>
          On September 15, 2020, UIUC instituted a moratorium on
          &ldquo;research, teaching, display, imaging, and circulation of human
          remains and cultural items that are potentially subject to
          NAGPRA,&rdquo; (<a href="https://nagpra.illinois.edu/moratorium/"
            >Illinois NAGPRA Moratorium</a
          >) NAGPRA referring to the Native American Graves Protection and
          Repatriation Act of 1990. This law is meant to repatriate cultural
          items to the Native American group that they belong to. While most if
          not all of the materials in the Duke collection are not technically
          covered under NAGPRA, the university&rsquo;s moratorium indicates a
          commitment towards a more ethical, native-centered approach to the use
          and ownership of Native American materials.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only a few months later, in February 2021, the Doris Duke Charitable
          Foundation Announced that they were awarding grants to seven
          universities, including UIUC, &ldquo;to digitize, translate and index
          recordings and materials spanning 150 Indigenous cultures; improve
          their accessibility and utility to Native communities, tribal colleges
          and the wider public.&rdquo; (<a

        <h2>My Recommendations</h2>
        <p>
          Given the sensitive and intimate nature of many of the materials, and
          the colonialist underpinnings of the original gathering of the
          materials in the &lsquo;60s and &lsquo;70s, I am glad that the
          University Archives team under the leadership of Chris Prom and
          Bethany Anderson are seemingly considering the numerous ethical
          considerations of this project. They appear to recognize the major
          flaw of the original project: that indigenous community members had
          little involvement as co-creators in the project, but were instead
          treated in some cases like &lsquo;lab&rsquo; subjects to be studied.
          Still, there is tremendous historic and cultural value to the lasting
          materials that were generated by this project, and the primary
          benefactors of that legacy ought to be the tribes themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The revitalization project is still in its early stages, and no doubt
          numerous issues will emerge as they move forward. It seems that a lot
          of the work at this stage is simply doing a better job identifying the
          materials in the collection in order to facilitate a conversation with
          tribal representatives. Still it is critical that contemporary native
          voices are included in the conversation around these materials as soon
          as is feasible.
        </p>
        <p>
          My particular recommendation relates to the use of transcripts. I
          asked in class what the project was planning on doing in regards to
          oral history transcripts. Chris Prom stated that the original
          transcripts were likely done by the field researchers, and Bethany
          Anderson said that part of the grant project will support the
          transcription of tapes that have previously not been transcribed. She
          also said they may want to redo or enhance existing transcripts in
          some form, but it is unclear at this stage as they still need to take
          a closer look at the original tapes and the transcripts first.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chris Prom also indicated that, as best he could tell when reviewing
          access to the collection since 2003, all of the researchers who have
          looked at the collection have referred to the transcript instead of
          the original audio tapes. Part of this may be because of concerns that
          listening directly to the audio may be cumbersome and even put the
          physical tape at risk. However, it is my opinion that the preference
          towards textual transcripts over the spoken word is part of a
          Western-centric legacy that privileges literacy over more natural or
          &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; forms of communication like the spoken word.
          In my experience in working with oral histories, I prefer to think of
          the &lsquo;original&rsquo; source as the audio itself and view the
          transcript as a useful, though imperfect derivative. No doubt
          transcripts are critical especially for accessibility reasons, as well
          as for searchability and usability. Still, as an experienced
          transcriber, I can testify that a transcriptionist cannot create a
          100% recreation of the spoken word in transcript form. When I
          transcribe, I often have to make decisions about whether to include
          jumbled phrases, verbal ticks like &ldquo;um&rdquo;s, or other forms
          of communication that are not typically written when people
          communicate through text. No doubt a transcriptionist has various
          forms of implicit bias that may cause them to transcribe an indigenous
          person in particular ways that are not flattering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since these transcripts were presumably done by field researchers in
          the 60s and 70s, I am somewhat concerned that the transcripts have
          several problems that the project team will need to review as part of
          the project. My particular recommendation, therefore, is for them to
          compare the transcripts to the original audio to ensure that the
          transcripts are not only accurate, but also do not reinforce forms of
          bias against indigenous peoples. Most especially, contemporary
          indigenous peoples must be involved in this transcript-review process
          in some form.
