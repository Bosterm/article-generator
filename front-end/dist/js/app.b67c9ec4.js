Part of this may be because of concerns that listening directly to the audio may be cumbersome and even put the physical tape at risk. However, it is my opinion that the preference towards textual transcripts over the spoken word is part of a Western-centric legacy that privileges literacy over more natural or “primitive” forms of communication like the spoken word. In my experience in working with oral histories, I prefer to think of the ‘original’ source as the audio itself and view the transcript as a useful, though imperfect derivative. No doubt transcripts are critical especially for accessibility reasons, as well as for searchability and usability. Still, as an experienced transcriber, I can testify that a transcriber cannot 100% recreate the spoken word as a transcript. When I transcribe, I often have to make decisions about whether to include jumbled phrases, verbal ticks like “um”s, or other forms of communication that are not typically written when people communicate through text. No doubt a transcriber has various forms of implicit bias that may cause them to transcribe an indigenous person in particular ways that are not flattering.
